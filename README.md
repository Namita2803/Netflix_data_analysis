Netflix Data Analysis and Dashboard
This project presents a detailed analysis of Netflix titles using Python for data preprocessing and Power BI for interactive data visualization. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from the Netflix dataset by performing exploratory data analysis and building a dashboard that communicates key metrics effectively.

Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset using Python (Pandas).

Analyze trends in content types, release years, countries, and genres.

Visualize the data using Power BI with interactive and well-structured visuals.

Build a portfolio-ready dashboard for data analyst roles.

Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Power BI Desktop

GitHub
